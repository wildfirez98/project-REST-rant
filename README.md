# Project REST-Rant #

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

1.) Setup project initial steps with "Express Checklist"
        
- Create new folder
- Create index.js
- Run "npm init -y" to create package.json file with defaults
- Run "npm install express" so we can make our project an Express framework application
- Require express at the top of the index.js file
- Initialize the app variable
- Create a home page route:
     - Call app.get()
     - Set ‘/‘ as the path (first arg)
     - Write callback function with (req, res) as second arg
     - Call res.send("Hello World")

2.) Additional Steps:

- Setup .gitignore file
- Setup Github repo
- Add .env file 
- After creating the .env file you must install dotenv for the project by running "npm i dotenv"
- Add "require('dotenv').config()" to top of index.js
- Update server listen port to app.listen(process.env.PORT) so we pull PORT variable from .env file
- Create Wildcard route in index.js at bottom of the file so it doesn't override other endpoints
- Setup Controllers folder and file
- Import the router in index.js 
- Create first route in controller file pointed towards '/' directory

1.) Continued on Part 2:
- Completed building stub routes table in README.md - creating tables was challenging due to formatting/spacing issues but figured it out.
- Plan my data. Restaraunts shall consist of (blank table for now):

     |    Name    |      City    |     State    |    Cuisines    |               Picture              |
     | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
     |            |              |              |                |                                    |

2.) Making default view:
- Run "npm i react express-react" this will install both 'react' and 'express-react-views'
- Create 'views' folder in project
- Create 'default.jsx' in 'views' folder

3.) Creating a layout page

4.) Continue building README
