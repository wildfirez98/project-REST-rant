# Project REST-Rant #

REST-Rant is an app where users can review restaurants.

## February 22, 2022 ##
1.) Setup project initial steps with "Express Checklist"
        
- Create new folder
- Create index.js
- Run "npm init -y" to create package.json file with defaults
- Run "npm install express" so we can make our project an Express framework application
- Require express at the top of the index.js file
- Initialize the app variable
- Create a home page route:
     - Call app.get()
     - Set ‘/‘ as the path (first arg)
     - Write callback function with (req, res) as second arg
     - Call res.send("Hello World")

2.) Additional Steps:

- Setup .gitignore file
- Setup Github repo
- Add .env file 
- After creating the .env file you must install dotenv for the project by running "npm i dotenv"
- Add "require('dotenv').config()" to top of index.js
- Update server listen port to app.listen(process.env.PORT) so we pull PORT variable from .env file
- Create Wildcard route in index.js at bottom of the file so it doesn't override other endpoints
- Setup Controllers folder and file
- Import the router in index.js 
- Create first route in controller file pointed towards '/' directory
